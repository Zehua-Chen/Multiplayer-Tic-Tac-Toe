## Editing the Source Files

* **VS Code**: you do not have to do anything to edit the project in vs code, as Typescript is 
supported out of the box by VS Code;

* **Atom**: install the package `atom-typescript` to enable autocomplete and syntax
highlighting for typescript and typescript react, and `autocomplete-path` to enable import
path completion; I also recommends the package `auto-detect-indentation` your editor can indent
lines correctly as your press enter.

### Indentation

* All files ends with `.js` and `.ts` have **four spaces** for indent width;
* All files ends with `.jsx` and `.tsx` have **two spaces** for indent width;
